My First Game Ever, learned c# and unity engine!!!

My first unity project written in c#. I learn about how to play around unity. I developed the majority of the enemies, do their placement, and affect on their destory(Spawn new enemies, bullets, or collectable), I also designed the gamecontrol system to intergate everything component of the game together.
