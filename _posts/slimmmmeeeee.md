In this project, I developed a main character with kinematic-based movement and fine-tuned controls. I also explored how to design effective player guidance within a game. Every aspect of the project was created by me, except for some free art assets sourced online. The most excited part is i invest into "death" mechism in the game, with descent understanding now. Sadly I dont have enough time to implement more mechism for this is a two week project complete within school days.
